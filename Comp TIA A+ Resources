CompTIA A+ (220-1101 and 220-1102):

Focus: Foundational IT skills, including hardware, operating systems, networking, troubleshooting, and security basics.
It's aimed at beginners and is often the first certification IT professionals earn.
CompTIA Network+ (N10-009):

Focus: Networking concepts, including network infrastructure, protocols, security, and troubleshooting.
It's more advanced than A+ and is a good next step if you want to specialize in networking or improve your network security skills.
CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701):

Focus: Cybersecurity fundamentals, including threats, vulnerabilities, risk management, encryption, and network security.
This is the next step after A+ or Network+ if you're focusing specifically on cybersecurity.
